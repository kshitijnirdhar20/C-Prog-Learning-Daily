# 💻 C Programming Daily 🚀

Welcome to my **C Programming Daily Practice Journey**! This repository is my commitment to master C programming through consistent daily effort — one line of code, one concept at a time.

I started this repo to:
- 📘 Track my daily C programming progress
- 🧠 Strengthen problem-solving and logic-building skills
- 🛠️ Practice core concepts like pointers, arrays, structures, and more
- 🟩 Maintain my GitHub contribution streak with meaningful commits
---

## 📅 My Goal

> 📌 **One valuable C-related commit per day.**

It could be a solved problem, a new concept implemented, notes on syntax or memory management — anything that sharpens my C skills, shared daily.

## 🔧 Topics I Plan to Cover

- Basics of C (syntax, operators, data types)
- Conditional & Looping Statements
- Functions & Recursion
- Arrays, Strings, and Pointers
- Structures & Unions
- File I/O
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Mini Projects & Algorithms
